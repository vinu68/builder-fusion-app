- **SOLID**
  - Single Responsibility: one component = one concern
  - Open/Closed: extend via props
  - Liskov: substitutable components
  - Interface Segregation: small props
  - Dependency Inversion: depend on service interfaces

- **Security**
  - Tokens in HTTP-only cookies
  - Role checks server-side
  - Input validation, CSP headers

- **Testing**
  - Unit tests with React Testing Library
